            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>Explore the realm of Computational Design by replicating and reinterpreting a seminal piece of generative art created by pioneers like Manfred Mohr or James Whitney. Utilizing TouchDesigner, I was to replicate an iconic work and enhance it with an element of interactivity, thereby creating a unique blend of historical artistry and modern interactive design.</p>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>This is an introductory project for Visual Communication Design 3, a course exploring web-based interactivity for desktop, mobile, and emerging digital contexts. The goals of this project were to learn about the history of generative animation and to practice computational design in Touch Designer by transforming an animated work into an interactive experience.</p>
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>I took on the role of an interaction designer for this project, taking an audio/visual piece and tranforming it into an audio-reactive piece. I was guided by my professor, Nik Swift, who provided guidance and technical support as I navigated learning Touch Designer.</p>

            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="discover">Discover</h2>
            <p>This project is inspired by the works of generative art pioneers.</p>
            <h3>John Whitney's Catalog</h3>
            <p>I was inspired by a part of John Whitney's work, "Catalog:"</p>
            <div class="center flex-row">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbV7loKp69s?si=084TD4zgaQlEVOum&amp;start=316" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>John Whitney was both an animator and composer. This piece stood out to me, because I am interested in the interaction between visuals and audio. In this piece, Whitney paired his original musical composition with visuals he crafted using an analog computer and a camera film contraption he built from a WWII anti-aircraft gun sight. The piece was as much as a technical feat as an art masterpiece. The Slit Scan technique Whitney developed for this piece was used to create special effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey, seven years later.</p>
            <h3>Guiding Question</h3>
            <p>How might we provide a way to pay homage to John Whitney's Catalog with interactive generative design?</p>
            <p>In order to pay homage to Whitney's piece, I sought to understand it's cultural significance and broken down audio/visual pieces.</p>
            <h3>Perception of the Piece</h3>
            <p>Whitney's Catalog was an important part of the 1960s psychedelia movement. His piece was designed to be and remembered by people for being <b>mesmerizing</b>, so this is an experience that I hoped to emulate in my final piece.</p>
            <h3>Breaking Down Catalog</h3>
            <p>Many moving pieces (literally!) went into designing this piece, so I have broken down which elements I focused on for my recreation.</p>
            <h6>Music</h6>
            <p>The audio that Whitney composed for his piece was incredibly haunting and yet modern, which were key to the unique experience of the short film.</p>
            <h6>Circle of Circles</h6>
            <p>Whitney did not just draw outlines of circles, but simulated the outline of a circle with more circles, which grew in radius as the animation progressed and created a scattering effect.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/circle-of-circles.png" alt="diagram showing circle of circles." class="soft"/>
                <figcaption>
                    <p>Each cirle outline is composed of 16 smaller circles.</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure></div>
            <h6>Waves of Circles</h6>
            <p>Key to the magic of the circles in his piece was the way they appeared in waves across the screen coordinated with the music.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/circle-waves.png" alt="diagram showing circle of circles." class="soft"/>
                <figcaption>
                    <p>One set of circles scatters as another grows.</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure></div>
            <h6>Randomness</h6>
            <p>Key to making this an engaging experience was the element of randomness that Whitney applied. The circles appeared in random locations with random colors, which kept people excited not knowing what to expect next.</p>

            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="design">Design</h2>
            <h3>Creating the Magic</h3>
            <h6>Audio-Reactive Visuals</h6>
            <p>Because of the way that the visuals in Catalog were so intertwined with the audio Whitney composed, I decided to make the interactive component of my project a reaction to inputted audio files. I used Whitney's original audio as the demo file to test the interaction in its original context.</p>
            <p>I broke down the challenge of designing audio-reactive visuals by first completing a tutorial, then tailoring the reaction to fit Whitney's composition.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/audio-interpolation.png" alt="diagram showing network of audio visuals." class="soft"/>

                    <p>Network of audio-generated visuals.</p>

            </figure></div>
            <div class="center flex-row">

            </div>
            <h6>Circle of Circles</h6>
            <p>Designing the circle of circles was a challenge, but I learned a lot about both different ways to design shapes and instancing from the experience.</p>
            <p>My first attempt to create the circle of circles was to instance circles at points in the outline of other circles. This was a perfect solution in isolation, however it did not scale to the scope of the full project, because it is very difficult to create instances of instances in Touch Designer.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/instanced-circle-of-circles.png" alt="instanced circle of circles." class="soft"/>
                <figcaption>
                    <p>Network of circle of circles created using instancing.</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure></div>
            <p>Nik helped me come up with a solution that used merging rather than instancing. This helped me realize that there are different ways to get similar outputs in Touch Designer, and you should look to the future of how elements fit into the larger project to choose which method is best.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/merge.png" alt="merged circle of circles." class="soft"/>
                <figcaption>
                    <p>Network of circle of circles created using merging.</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure></div>
            <p>Both outputted a circle of circles, but the merged solution fit better into the overall project.</p>

            <h6>Random Waves of Circles</h6>
            <p>I used random noise to create waves of circles of different colors.</p>
            <div class="center"><figure>
                <img src="assets/catalog/noise.png" alt="merged circle of circles." class="soft"/>
                <figcaption>
                    <p>Network of noise used to create instances of circles of circles.</p>

            <h3>An Audio-Reactive Recreation</h3>
            <p>These pieces came together to create a final ouput of this immersive experience is an Audio-Reactive animation, in which users can input their favorite audio and watch it react the way that John Whitney's animation would have done. As a demo song, I entered the original audio that he composed for Catalog.</p>

                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbV7loKp69s?si=084TD4zgaQlEVOum&amp;start=316" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <h6>Audio Files are Important.</h6>
            <p>A core component of this project was using Whitney's original composition, and that was not something I was willing to compromise on. This made it extremely difficult to interpolate the composition, because it was not availible as a MIDI audio file. That meant that I had to spend a lot of time playing around with different audio operators to get a result that followed the flow of Whitney's composition.</p>
            <h6>Recreate the experience, not the piece.</h6>
            <p>Trying to recreate the exact piece that Whitney designed would have taken away it's interactive experience and not made the most of the tools Touch Designer had to offer. I learned that even with my best efforts, I could not recreate Whitney's piece exactly, and once I began to focus on recreating the experience with respect to the original piece, I ended with a better result than I could have imagined.</p>
            <h6>Break Things Down.</h6>
            <p>I truly believed multiple times throughout this project that it was impossible to recreate Whitney's work. Once I broke down the project into steps and took on one challenge at a time, it became manageable. I started by learning audio-reactive visuals, then Instancing, then Noise generative instancing, then finally fine-tuned audio interpolation. I was also able to find better learning resources by breaking down the challenges into smaller and less specific elements.</p>
