            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>Conceptualize, design, and develop an AR filter that comments on, critiques, or responds to the social issue of social media addiction.</p>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>This is an introductory project for Visual Communication Design 3, a course exploring web-based interactivity for desktop, mobile, and emerging digital contexts. The goals of this project were to familiarize ourselves with AR technology and design in the context of social applications.</p>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>Design an AR filter that addresses a social problem.</p>
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <h6>3 Weeks</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1 week familiarizing with Spark AR</span> </li>
                <li><span>1 week researching compliment habits</span></li>
                <li><span>1 week designing, developing, and testing filter</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I worked independently on this project guided by valuable feedback and critiques from my professor and classmates. I acted as a UX Researcher, JavaScript developer, and meme designer throughout this project.</p>
            
            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="discover">Discover</h2>
            <p>Throughout this project, I focused on the social issues of the negative impact of social media on self-image and the drift away from authentic social connection on these platforms.</p>
            <p>More specifically, I tested the sharing of compliments virtually as a means to promote social connection and positive self-image.</p>
            <h3>Defining the User</h3>
            <p>It is well <a href = "https://press.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n1673/pdf/Nan_Sun.pdf">documented</a> that women are more likely to give and recieve compliments, so I decided to focus my effort on designing a filter for masculine people.</p>
            <h3>Exploratory Observation</h3>
            <p>In order to understand where this discrepancy is coming from, I asked a group of three people who identified as men and directed them to compliment one another. Their first compliments were humorous and many used profanity. Such compliments helped the recipient laugh but was not necessarily meaningful.</p>
            <p>I then directed them to offer serious compliments specific to the recipient. All participants became quiet and two out of three expressed discomfort. This indicated that offering serious compliments was intimidating to the participants. I confirmed this with participants, who explained that they preferred to express compliments ironically or with humor.</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img class="soft" src="assets/complimeme/bridge.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>I confirmed this observation with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/okryiz/what_are_some_good_compliments_to_give_men/" target="_blank">reddit thread</a> in which masculine people candidly discussed how they prefer to give and recieve compliments. I found based on this information that the easiest compliments to share are humorous and the most meaningful are specific and personal.</p>
            <h3>User Need</h3>
            <p>Masculine people need a way to share and recieve meaningful compliments, because directly verbally expressing compliments is intimidating.</p>
            <h3>Guiding Question</h3>
            <p>How might we provide a way for masculine people to share humorous compliments that are meaningful to the recipient?</p>
            
            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="design">Design</h2>
            <h3>Filters in Context</h3>
            <p>At first, I had a difficult time understanding how to use a simple AR Filter experience for social good. I looked at the filter in context by creating a mind map to understand how to take advantage of not only the filter, but how it fits into the larger social media experience.</p>
            <h6>Filter Affordances</h6>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/context.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
            </div>
            <p>Analyzing the inputs, affordances, and output of filters helped me understand the social opportunities of filters.</p>
            <h6>Portrait Screen Usage</h6>
            <p>In order to immerse the user in the filter, I analyzed where users typically place their faces in the frame. People most frequently placed their faces in the red area on the bottom right corner of the screen, because that is a comfortable position for right-handed individulals. Users least frequently placed their faces in the top, blue part of the frame, because that is the part of the camera furthest away from the user. I used this information to create memes that left space for the user, but was more immersive than a frame. Having these guidelines also helped me keep each of the rotating "which are you" backgrounds consistent.</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/Usage.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
            </div>
            <h3>Finding a Solution</h3>
            <p>Throughout this project, I iterated on a number of designs, getting feedback from my classmates and re-designing.</p>
            <h6>Initial Design</h3>
            <p>My initial design was a simple banner connected to the users' forehead that would prompt the user to share with a friend and show a simple compliment. This was good practice in using the Snapchat lens platform, but did not lean enough into the humor side of sharing compliments.</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/initial.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
            </div>
            <h6>Mockup Ideas</h3>
            <p>Moving forward, I decided to lean into the style of memes.</p>
            <div class="flex-row VertDivider">
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/forehead.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/card.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/pattern.png" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
            </div>
            <h6>Final Design</h3>
            <p>My final design was inspired by valentines day grams. I referenced these with silly cut outs of popular meme characters, colorful backgrounds, and comic sans fonts. The reference to these memes makes the compliments easy to share and intuitive to understand.</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="/assets/complimeme/gains.JPG" class="soft" style="height: 500px; width: auto"/>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="gradient-title" id="deliver">Deliver</h2>
            <h3>Deciding on a platform</h3>
            <p>Although this project was meant to be completed in Meta's Spark AR, I decided to develop this filter for Snap Lens Studio, because of the social nature and ease of use of filter-sharing on Snapchat.</p>
            <h3>Introducing the Filter</h3>
            <p>Equally as important as the content of the filter itself is how the filter is introduced to users on the platform. All lenses have a filter logo and demo video. I took this opportunity to present the filter as silly and fun to prepare the user for the experience of using it.</p>
            <div class="center" >

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <h6>Any tool can be used for Social Good.</h6>
            <p>When we started this project, I was very skeptical as to how the filters we use every day for laughs could become an instrument for social good. Once I looked beyond the filter iteslf, though, and its context within social media, I found that these filters promote sharing laughs with friends. I took advantage of this unique setting to promote postitive social interactions to combat negative self-perception and loneliness.</p>
            <h6>Always be open to feedback.</h6>
            <p>We were offered opportunities throughout this project to share our progress with classmates. Even when my filter was nowhere near close to finished, I was brave enough to present it to the class to hear their feedback. My classmates' critiques and collaboration throughout pushed my designs to be relateable to most young people, the target participants in this campaign.</p>
            <h6>There is a place for Comic Sans.</h6>
            <p>I understand this might be a hot take. I never thought I would see the day where Comic Sans is featured on my design portfolio, yet here we are. I couldn't imagine a better font to set a casual and silly tone in the context of memes.</p>
            <h6>Power of Humor</h6>
            <p>Unironically, memes are very powerful. By putting the serious compliments in the context of humor, they were more approachable and more frequently shared.</p>
            <h6>Unclear Use Case</h6>
            <p>I found that some users assumed the filter was meant to compliment themselves. In the future, I could try different ways to indicate that the compliments are meant to be shared with a friend.</p>
