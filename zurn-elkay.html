                        <p>After the Zurn and Elkay merger, sales reps had to manage multiple sales enablement platforms. I redesigned the sales interface between reps and Zurn-Elkay to fit seamlessly into their workflows and reinforce the unified brand.</p>
                        <p>This project challenged me to be relentlessly curious and resourceful while testing assumptions to maximize limited opportunity for feedback from busy users.</p>

                <h3 id="overview">Once upon a time, Zurn and Elkay merged and lived happily ever after, right?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but before they lived happily as one Zurn-Elkay, it was my role to help bring the sales representatives of these two brand families together through a unified sales-enablement platform.</p>
                <img alt="Zurn and Elkay Logos combining to form one Zurn-Elkay" src="assets/zurn-elkay/merger-logos.png"/>
                <p>Zurn used a platform called Highspot, while Elkay developed “RepMyElkay.” Each of these tools had the same purpose for our teams: to provide sales representatives with order search tools and educational reference materials.</p>
                <img alt="Place of our solution in network with Sales Reps' current workflow" src="assets/zurn-elkay/SE-Map.png"/>
                <p>The system I was tasked with designing would be a based on the internally developed RepMyElkay, keeping in mind the structure and functionality of Highspot Zurn Reps were used to.</p>

                <p>To thoroughly understand the context of Zurn-Elkay Sales Reps’ roles, I mapped the ecosystem to which they belong:</p>
                <img alt="Channel marketing model diagram"/>
                <p>Zurn-Elkay has an indirect sales model in which they work with channel intermediaries to distribute their products to many different types of customers.</p>
                <img alt="Diagram depicting Sales Rep Experience working for many brands inside and outside of the Zurn-Elkay Family"/>
                <p>The sales reps at these independent distributors work with brands inside and outside of the Zurn-Elkay family, so it was crucial that the system we build not only provides tools and information, but also reinforces brand values and builds trust in our partnership.</p>

                <h3 id="overview">RepMyElkay: An Origin Story and a Cautionary Tale</h3>
                <p>To understand reps’ experiences with RepMyElkay, our current platform, I used data available from Microsoft Clarity. By analyzing heatmaps of user clicks and recordings of user sessions, I was able to piece together valuable insights.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img alt="" src="assets/zurn-elkay/main-menu-heatmap.png"/>    
                    <figcaption><p>Heatmap of homepage showing 40 percent of users first using order search and 25 percent first using library (reference materials hub).</p></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Sales reps exhibited cognitive overload on the homepage, most hovering over different options for 3-5 seconds before taking action.</p>
                <p>Most reps completed a single task per session, typically checking order information or downloading specific reference materials, leaving the platform immediately after.</li>
                <p>Together, this indicates that reps use “RepMyElkay” as a reference tool and with a specific goal in mind, but struggle to identify the best path to accomplish their goal on our current platform.</p>

                <h3 id="user-need">Watching Out for Current Usage Bias</h3>
                <p>We initially assumed a mobile version of the platform was unnecessary based on data showing no site usage from these devices. However, looking at the context of when and where sales reps use sales enablement platforms revealed that sales reps often need access to info on the go or in the field.</p>
                <p>Loading RepMyElkay on a mobile device revealed a messy, non-functional home screen. Microsoft Clarity data showed a 100% bounce rate on mobile, indicating unmet demand for a mobile version.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the quick tag search feature saw little use because it was buried. Once we brought it to the forefront of the search experience, its usage increased significantly.</p>

                <p>Because sales reps work for brands inside and outside of the Zurn-Elkay family, our sales enablement platform should follow the standard design conventions of other platforms.</p>                
                <p>Our initial findings showed that reps had a difficult time discerning the steps necessary through the current platform to accomplish their goals.</p>
                <p><b>Sales Reps Across all Zurn-Elkay Brands Need a Unified Sales Enablement Experience that works like other platforms</b>, because they have a goal in mind when they use our platform, but struggle with execution, which builds frustration associated with our brand and hinders their ability to sell our products.</p>

                <p>We started our competitive analysis with Highspot, the platform Zurn used prior to the merger.</p>

                    <img alt="Screenshot of the Highspot Reference Material Library which has images for each category to indicate to reps where the information they are looking for might be located." src="assets/zurn-elkay/Highspot.png"/>
                    <figcaption><p>Highspot has a clear navigation with task-focused pages.</p></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Highspot’s usage analytics confirmed that the reps’ two main jobs to be done were order search and reference material download, even among more features available to reps on this platform.</p>
                <p>The platform effectively supports these tasks with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A central navigation</li>
                    <li>Pages dedicated to a single task</li>
                    <li>Visual categorization of reference materials</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The main drawbacks of the platform were:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Features irrelevant to our team cluttering the interface</li>
                    <li>Inefficient search and filter options</li>
                    <li>Enterprise pricing that increases with the number of accounts</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From Highspot's insights, we concluded that while its advanced functions like previewing and saving drafts are beneficial for content writers, they are too complex and outside the scope for our sales reps-focused minimum viable solution.</p>

                <p>In the first high-fidelity prototypes I designed, I focused on functional UX Design rather than UI style details. Admittedly, I was also a bit hesitant to be more playful with the design for a tool used in a professional setting.</p>
                <img alt="Interface with only navy and grayscale colors and rectangular footer" src="assets/zurn-elkay/Bland.png"/>
                <p>Although the system met the functional needs of the reps, the style did not take into account the emotional need to build a relationship with the Zurn-Elkay Brand they represented.</p>
                <img alt="Interface with zurn-elkay branded blues and greens and a wave-shaped footer" src="assets/zurn-elkay/styled.png"/>
                <p>To foster a sense of pride in the organization, I incorporated more brand colors while staying within WCAG2 Accessibility color contrast guidelines. I also incorporated the theme of water and sustainability in the wave-shaped footer.</p>

                <p>Without the opportunity to interview reps directly, it was imperative that we test our design assumptions.</p>
                <p><b>Nine</b> of our sales reps completed two tasks on the prototype modeled after their two key jobs to be done: checking order information and downloading reference materials.</p>
                <p>Our research goals were to understand the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Have we reduced the initial cognitive load?<br/>Measure: time to first action</span></li>

                <p>After running usability testing, Sales Reps indicated that they were happy with core components of the interface design. They were able to make decisions and complete tasks faster than using “RepMyElkay.”</p>
                <p>That being said, some still had a negative experience downloading specific reference materials.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>"This makes assumptions that user know where to look for these items, only a seasoned rep would know where to look." - Zurn-Elkay Sales Rep</p>
                </div>
                <p>Our usability testing uncovered a pain beyond the interface we designed. The way reference material files were currently organized was not clear to reps. After this testing, we worked with the marketing team to audit of all reference materials housed in the library and reorganized the file structure to create more obvious groupings, then set standards for how new files could be named and where they should be stored.</p>

                <p>Thoughtfully organized information and interface makes it easier and faster for reps to search order info and download reference materials. Our responsive system makes the tool accessible on the go and in the field.</p>
                <p>Creating a better experience for sales reps means that they will be able to focus on their role making sales for Zurn-Elkay. Additionally, developing a solution in house saves the money we had been spending on Highspot subscriptions and creates a more scalable solution.</p>

                <p>Although we didn’t have the opportunity to directly observe or interview reps, I used my curiosity to sift through swaths of user session data and my empathy to use my knowledge of reps’ roles and context, which allowed me to piece together valuable insights to motivate our redesign.</p>
                <p>Watching sessions from current users helped us gain knowledge of how the current tool was being used, but it presented a view biased by the current solution. In order to understand unknown unknowns, it was vital that we analyzed  tested the assumptions in our designs to come up with some of our most valuable insights, like the importance of having a mobile version of the system and an intuitive information architecture.</p>
